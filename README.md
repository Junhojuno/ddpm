# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
This repo, unofficial implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, is re-produced for making it to understand ddpm easier. <br>
- Tensorflow-based implementation. official code is also Tensorflow but hard to get it.
- words like variables' names, are named by following the paper that those are used.
